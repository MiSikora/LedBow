LedBow
======

An Arduino project to control a LED strip attached to a violin bow.

Projects should work as is with a PlatformIO ecosystem. Assembly of the whole kit is based more or less on the Violin Bow Lightsabe project - https://bithead942.wordpress.com/2017/01/21/violin-bow-light-saber.

Demonstration of the bow below. Some of the effects are not displayed properly on the video but you can get the gist of it.
